# project-structure-creator

This project was developed to make creation of multiple related files easy.

You'll find a txt file, filled with descriptions of files and folders, and a folder called "templates" with a few files.

In this first version, our code asks for two parameters to change into the files:

- namespace  - {namespace}
- fileprefix - {nova-tela}
